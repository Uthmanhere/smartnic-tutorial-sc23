# README for Hands-On Code Demos

This directory contains sample code that can be walked through and executed on the HPC Advisory Council cluster using BlueField 3 Data Processing Units (DPUs). 

Each code example uses the same environment setup, and specific scripts and test cases are included in each folder along with any added documentation.
